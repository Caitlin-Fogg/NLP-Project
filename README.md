# NLP-Project
This was a project for our Natural Language Processing module. It explores two different models for information extraction, namely a Hidden Markov Model coded and trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Bidirectional LSTM with Conditional Random Fields.

My contribution was coding both models.

Note that copying the .ipynb from Google Colab missed the first cell with the HMM. To view the full source code, open the project via the Google Colab link.
